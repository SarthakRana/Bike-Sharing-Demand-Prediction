Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations 
throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is 
explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants 
are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following dependecies before running the app:

- pandas `pip install pandas`
- numpy `pip install numpy`
- scipy `pip install scipy`
- scikit learn `pip install scikit-learn`
- streamlit `pip install streamlit`

```

You can also download the ZIP as well.

### Usage

1. Install all dependencies mentioned in __Prerequisites__.
2. Open CLI/prompt and make sure Streamlit is installed by running the command `streamlit --version`. You should see something like this : `Streamlit, version 0.67.1`.
3. Do this for all other dependencies as well just to make sure everything is in right place and you are good to go.
4. Go to your working directory(where you have placed the .py file and other components) and open CLI.prompt there.
5. Type in the following command and press Enter :<br>
   `streamlit run app.py`<br>
